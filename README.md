# IoT_Based_Smart_Agriculture_Model
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrivoltaic">Photovoltaic agriculture</a>, the combination of photovoltaic power generation and agricultural activities, is a natural response to supply the green and sustainable electricity for agriculture. Photovoltaic agriculture can effectively alleviate the contradiction between more population and less land, powerfully promote the development of controlled environmental agriculture, evidently increase economic benefits of farmers, and significantly improve environment by reducing the emissions. PA farms are developed in few countries to elevate employment and fror research purposes. China is a leading player in this field.<br><br>
In this project I built a mini pa farm which uses sun tracking solar panel to effectively capture solar energy and used a soil moisture sensor along with a motor pump to water the plants if the soil gets a bit dry to notify the user when this happens.<br><i>(As my nodemcu can only power upto 3v I used arduino uno along side to power up the modules.)
